## What is tahskr?
tahskr is a simple, open source, self-hosted todo manager.

There are two parts to tahskr. The [**server side**](https://github.com/Dullage/tahskr-server) that stores and serves data and the **frontend** (that's this repo) that provides a web interface accessible from a mobile/desktop browser or Windows Electron app.

Both parts can be self-hosted but you only really need to self-host the server side as [tahskr.com](https://tahskr.com) or the published Electron app can be used to access data on any tahskr server.

## Download
You can download the tahskr Electron app from the [releases](https://github.com/Dullage/tahskr/releases) area of this repo.

Also, as noted above, anyone can access their own tahskr server from [tahskr.com](https://tahskr.com).
